    "Methane (CH4) has an atmospheric mixing ratio of about 1800ppb. Carbon monoxide (CO) has a global average mixing ratio in the neighborhood of 100ppb. Global annual emissions of CH4 are about 600Tg(CH4)yr-1 (Table2.11); global annual CO sources are estimated as 2780Tg(CO)yr-1 (Table2.15). How can the atmospheric concentration of CH4 be almost 20 times higher than that of CO given their relative emissions? (Problem suggested by T.S.Dibble.)"

    "Beryllium-7 is produced by cosmic rays in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. Similarly to 210Pb, it condenses immediately on preexisting aerosol particles. The global source of 7 Be is 150 g yr-1; 70% of that source is in the stratosphere and 30% is in the troposphere. Removal of 7 Be is by radioactive decay (half-life of 53 days) and by aerosol deposition (in the troposphere only). We assume that the troposphere and stratosphere are well-mixed reservoirs, that 7 Be is at steady state in each of these reservoirs, and that the transfer rate constant from the stratosphere to the troposphere is k ST = 0.8 yr -1. The total mass of 7 Be in the troposphere is estimated from observations to be about 3 g. Derive the residence time against deposition of 7 Be-carrying aerosols in the troposphere. You should find a value of 24 days."
